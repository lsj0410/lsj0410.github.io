Whilst reading 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th edition)' by Kurose and Ross, a footnote on page 549 drew my attention.
It was attached to a section explaining the structure of Bluetooth.

>The terms used below may differ from the terms found in the official Bluetooth Specification. The terms used in the official specification
> DO NOT allign with Pearson's commitment to promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion, and protecting against bias and stereotyping
> in the global population of the learners we serve.

I looked up what the difference between the book and the official terms was, and found that what the book called 'Centralized Controller'
and 'Client Device' were named 'Master' and 'Slave' in the official specification.

I shared this discovery with several friends, one of whom pointed me to the following article.

The article itself is interesting, and the comments were also intriguing. The fact that many people(since this article was in 2020,
 I believe there are more now) are putting efforts to remove offensive terms from engineering was for me encouraging.
