I was first introduced to Qiskit in 2020, when I participated in IBM Quantum Challenge 2020. Back then I thought
 Qiskit was pronounced "cue-is-kit". I only recently found out that it was actually more like "kiss-kit". After
 the first few problems I left the challenge and had never dealt with Qiskit since.
 
Recently I have come to join WISET's mentoring program as a mentee of Team Quantum is here, a mentoring team
 of wonderful women in IBM Quantum. Through their guidance I reconciled with this interesting tool I had
 left two years ago.

From now on I will try to post the progress I make on investigating Qiskit and quantum computing.
